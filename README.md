  ### TOOLS USED

- Ms. Excel
- SQL
- Power Bi

## ACTIVITY CARRIED OUT

  - Downloading the sales data table on various tools used.

 - using pivot table for summarisation,and pivot chart for visualisation on Excel.
- Writing queries on SQL to provide result for the findings.
Data transformation,
- Data cleaning,viewing data status on column quality,column profile,column distribution. Column calculations and measure,and data visualisation on power Bi.

## SUMMARY FOR EACH TOOL USED

  From Ms. Excel analysis, the following pivot tables were prepared for the summary of the sales data.

- Total sales by product--- pivot table 2 

- Total sales by Month---   Pivot table 4
- Total sales by Region---Pivot table 6

- Average sales by product--- Pivot table 8

### SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS

Based on the analysed data, the following findings from the analysis are highlighted below;

- The salesdata table given contains 50,001rows with  the heading inclusive.

- Total sales column was calculated using                = PRODUCT(UNIT PRICE * QUANTITY)

- Total Revenue column was calculated by duplicating Total sales and renaming. Since Total Revenue = Quantity X price.

 - List of Tables connected to slicer for interactive activities are mentioned earlier.

- It is discovered that Total quantity was (345,000) in number.

- Sum of product number was calculated using new column and measure

- Shoes are the top selling product by total sales of (#3,087,500) ,next to shirt and hat.

While the Southern region has the highest sum of total sales(total revenue) and highest sum of quantity. Eastern region is the second with higher revenue which recorded the top selling product.

 

### Conclusion:

In line with the above findings, it can be deduced that the products were correctly distributed to the regions by well trained staff. The reason is that; no errors was recorded on the recording. No blank cells recorded and it seems monitoring of sales and inventory were made on regular bases.
